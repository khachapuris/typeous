If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the -c nor the
-s option has been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the
name of a file containing shell commands. If bash is invoked in this
fashion, $0 is set to the name of the file, and the positional parame-
ters are set to the remaining arguments. Bash reads and executes com-
mands from this file, then exits. Bash's exit status is the exit status
of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are exe-
cuted, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to open the file
in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell
searches the directories in PATH for the script.
